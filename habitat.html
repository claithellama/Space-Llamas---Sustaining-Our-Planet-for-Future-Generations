    <b>The images above from <a href="https://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/" class="minilink">NASA Earth Observations</a> are from July of 2001 and 2020. It may be a bit difficult to see in these images, but Australia has a decrease in vegetation due primarily to wildfires this year.

    <h3>What’s causing this?</h3><p>
There are many ways habitats and ecosystem sizes are decreasing. The primary cause is human activity; deforestation, overgrazing, and destruction of wetlands are all ways humans are destroying habitats all over the world.
<br><br>
A lesser known cause of disappearing habitats and vegetation is a process called desertification. Desertification is when land permanently loses its productivity, becoming equivalent to a desert. It can be caused by drought, overgrazing by animals (normally farm animals), fires, and deforestation.
</p><br><h3>
What are the effects? 
</h3><p>
Many plants and animals don’t survive after losing their homes, and those that do are forced to migrate to other places. Water quality in streams, rivers, lakes, bays, and oceans becomes worse as sediments that were previously absorbed by the forests, meadows, and wetlands are now washed directly into the tributaries. Organisms in the waterways die too, as the dust blocks out the sun and decreases dissolved oxygen in the water. 
Land that is desertified cannot support the plants and animals that were living there before. Humans also have to abandon that land, since they can no longer farm with that land. In addition, desertification contributes to famine in developing countries.
