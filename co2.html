      Rising CO<sub>2</sub> Levels

    <h3>
      What is happening?
    </h3><center><img src = "CO2 Levels2.jpg" width="40%" height="45%"></center><p>
      In the past 800,000 years, there have been cycles of low CO<sub>2</sub> during ice ages, with concentrations of 200 parts per million (ppm), and higher CO<sub>2</sub> during warmer periods. The CO<sub>2</sub> levels have never surpassed 300 ppm.
      <br> 
      (Source: <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/" class="minilink">NASA Climate Change</a>)
    </p><br><p>
      Today (measurement taken in 2019), CO<sub>2</sub> levels are around 410 ppm, higher than they have been for those 800,000 years. 
    </p><br><p>
      Unfortunately, the CO<sub>2</sub> levels are still rising, and much faster than they ever did naturally. Since the industrial revolution, the atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased around 100 times faster than they ever did in previous natural increases. 
    </p><br><h3>
      What's causing this?
    </h3><p>
      The burning of fossil fuels has caused carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere to rise extremely rapidly. 
    </p><br><h3>
      What are the effects?
    </h3><p>
      Carbon dioxide is an example of a greenhouse gas, which absorbs heat from the sun (this process is called the greenhouse effect).
    </p><br><p>
      The increase of CO<sub>2</sub> directly correlates with rising air temperatures, the changing climate, and <a href="ocean.html" class="minilink">ocean acidification</a>, while indirectly causing many other challenges.
