    <h1>
      More Natural Disasters
    </h1>
    <h3>
      What is happening?
    </h3><p class="normal">
      In recent years, there has been an increase in the number and severity of a multitude of natural disasters and weather-related incidents, such as hurricanes and extreme storms.
    </p><br><h3>
      What is causing this?
    </h3><p class="normal">
      <a href="co2.html" class="minilink">Rising CO<sub>2</sub> levels</a> have warmed Earth’s atmosphere and oceans significantly. Current climate models predict that <b>sea surface temperatures (SSTs)</b> may increase as much as 4.8 degrees Fahrenheit (2.7 degrees Celsius) by the end of the century. High SSTs are involved in the formation of hurricanes and extreme storms, both of which have ramped up in severity over recent years.
    </p><br><h3>
      What are the effects?
    </h3><p class="normal">
      Hurricane formation requires SSTs of over 79 degrees Fahrenheit (26 degrees Celsius). Since 1955, a record-breaking 17 above-normal hurricane seasons have been documented, the largest stretch in history. While there is not a significant increase in the number of Atlantic hurricanes, there is an increase in severity, as those that form are more likely to become Category 4 and 5 events.

      <center> <p class="funfact"><b>Fun (or not so fun) NASA fact: </b>
      A study by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California reveals that SSTs can also increase the number of extreme storms alongside their severity.<br>
      At our current rate, the number of extreme storms could rise by an astronomical 60% by the end of the century.

     <br><h3>
      How does this affect us?
    </h3><p class="normal">
      More hurricanes and storms means more flooding, crop damage, structural damage, and loss of life. Already, expected annual costs for hurricane and storm-related damages total to $54 billion, and that number can only increase as its related natural disasters do as well.
