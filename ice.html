      Ice caps and glaciers in Antarctica, Greenland, Alaska, and other locations are becoming smaller in size every year. Scientists estimate that by 2040, all ice in the Arctic may be gone. In 2009 and .29 years, the mass of Antarctic ice was 178.90 Gigatonnes (billions of tonnes), while in 2020 and .54 years the mass was 63.71 Gigatonnes.

      What's causing this?
    </h3><p>
      The burning of fossil fuels and deforestation has caused <a href="co2.html" class="minilink">carbon dioxide levels</a> in the atmosphere to rise extremely rapidly. As a greenhouse gas, CO2 absorbs heat from the sun and prevents it from leaving our atmosphere. This has led to higher overall temperatures and the melting of frozen structures.
    </p><br><h3>
      What are the effects?
    </h3><p>
      Melting ice caps and retreating glaciers cause sea levels to rise because of how there is more liquid water. This, in turn, causes natural disasters such as flooding and hurricanes to occur more frequently. Animals living in tundras like polar bears and penguins progressively lose more and more of their habitat, having nowhere to live.
    </p><br><h3>
      How does this affect us?
    </h3><p>
      <a href="disasters.html" class="minilink">Hurricanes and flooding</a> have caused widespread homelessness by destroying homes and other private property. The U.S. economy spends billions upon billions of dollars every year to mend the patches of destruction these cause.
