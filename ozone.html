		Depleting Ozone Layer
	</h1>

	
    <h3>
    What is happening?
    </h3><p class="normal">
    The atmospheric ozone layer absorbs harmful UV rays (in the form of UV-B rays) from the sun, protecting the life below. However, over the years, an area in the ozone layer near the Southern Hemisphere (called the “ozone hole”) has become depleted of ozone. Over the years, this area has become increasingly bigger.

    <center> <p class="funfact"><b>Fun (or not so fun) fact from NASA: </b>
    The area of the “ozone hole” increased by 9 million km<sup>2</sup> from  1979 to 2019. </p>

    <h3>
    What’s causing this?
    </h3><p class="normal">
    The use of aerosols has contributed to increased levels of chlorine and bromine. Certain molecules that contain these elements (such as chlorofluorocarbons) destroy ozone upon contact.
    </p><br><h3>
    What are the effects?
    </h3><p class="normal">
    As a result, the UV-B rays not absorbed in that area harm plants and animals. Plant growth and function are altered by the radiation, affecting biogeochemical cycles such as the carbon cycle. The early development and reproductive abilities of marine life is also affected, causing low populations.
    </p><br><h3>
    How does this affect us?
    </h3><p class="normal">
    Not only are plants and animals affected, increased exposure to UV-B rays has been linked to skin cancer and other severe health issues.
