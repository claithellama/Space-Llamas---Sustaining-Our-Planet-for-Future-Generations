    <h1>
    Ocean Acidification 
    </h1>

  <h3>
  What is happening?
  </h3><p>
  The combination of water and CO<sub>2</sub> results in the release of hydrogen ions (H+), which is making the ocean more acidic. 
  </p><br><h3>
   Whatâ€™s causing this?
  </h3> <p>
  Roughly 30% of the <a href="co2.html" class="minilink">carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) released into the atmosphere</a> makes its way into the ocean. 
  </p><br><h3>
  What are the effects?
  </h3><p>
  Many organisms need an optimal pH in their environment to live and develop. For example, clownfish larvae have a loss of function when the seawater pH deviates from around 8.1. Others, such as coral reefs and organisms with shells, need the carbonate ions that are consumed in its reaction with CO<sub>2</sub> to maintain their shells. Due to the decreasing levels of carbonate ions in the ocean, organisms lose their form of protection and have a higher possibility of dying.
  </p><br><h3>
  How does this affect us?
  </h3><p>
  We rely on the organisms in the ocean for food, medicine, recreation, and tourism. While many of the organisms we consume may not be directly affected by acidic waters, the ones further down in the food web, which these organisms consume, are. Just think, what would happen to us if our sources of seafood became obsolete? What would happen to the economy of places near the ocean, such as Maine, if the ocean lost its bounty?
