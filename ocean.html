      Data from <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/" class="minilink">NASA Climate Change.</a>
      </b></p> <br>
      <p>
      Sea levels have been rising all over the world since the Industrial Revolution. Every year, the sea level rises around ⅛ of an inch, but this rate is likely to increase. Flooding is now 300-900% more frequent than before. 
    </p><br><h3>
      What's causing this?
    </h3><p>
      90% of the heat causing the rising temperatures is absorbed by the oceans, and water expands as it heats. The <a href="ice.html" class="minilink">melting of ice caps</a> also increases the water volume. 
    </p><br><h3>
      What are the effects?
    </h3><p>
      Freshwater wetlands near the coasts would start getting contaminated with saltwater. The plants and animals that are adapted to live in freshwater wouldn’t survive the change. Land plants also do not fare well when the concentration of salt in the water they uptake increases.
    </p><br><h3>
      How does this affect us?
    </h3><p>
      It is easier than ever for <a href="disasters.html" class="minilink">storms to enlarge</a> and move inland. Many major cities are located along the coast, and thus the effects of storms from flooding, storm surges, and coastal erosion (such as housing destruction) are even greater.
