    <h1>
      Climate Change
    </h1>

    <h3>
      What's causing this?
    </h3><p>
      The burning of fossil fuels and deforestation has caused carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere to rise extremely rapidly. As a greenhouse gas, CO<sub>2</sub> absorbs heat from the sun and prevents it from leaving our atmosphere. This has led to higher overall temperatures.
    </p><br><h3>
      What is happening?
    </h3><p>
      Because of changing temperatures, ocean levels are rising, ice caps/glaciers are melting, habitats are being lost through desertification, and natural disasters occur more frequently.
    </p><br><h3>
      What are the effects?
    </h3><p>
      This has led to widespread negative impacts on plants and animals and the ecosystems they are in. Many biogeochemical cycles have been disrupted, causing chaos in the fundamental processes that sustain life. Plants and animals are faced with having nowhere to live in addition to not being able to develop properly as larvae or mature organisms.
    </p><br><h3>
      How does this affect us?
    </h3><p>
      Natural disasters and the melting of ice caps/retreating of glaciers have caused governments to spend money or lose money due to impacts on tourism and human welfare. As specific plant and animal population sizes are scrambled, such becomes the case for other populations in their food web. Humans face a shortage of food and medicine, and therefore human populations also have difficulties.
